# EngiKit: A Collection of Engineering Tools

A curated collection of lightweight, open-source, and practical tools for engineers and scientists.

---

## About This Project

EngiKit is a personal repository dedicated to sharing a series of small desktop applications designed to solve specific problems in various engineering and scientific fields. Each tool is developed with Python, features a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI), and is packaged as a standalone executable, requiring no complex installation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Collection

### 1. Silicon Photonics Waveguide Calculator

The inaugural tool in the EngiKit collection, designed for researchers and students in the field of photonics.

**Features:**
* Calculates waveguide parameters based on any two known values from **Propagation Constant (Œ≤)**, **Effective Refractive Index (n_eff)**, **Wavelength (Œª)**, and **Frequency (f)**.
* Features real-time, automatic conversion between wavelength (nm) and frequency (THz).
* Displays the physical formula used for each calculation.
* Keeps a running log of calculation history for easy review and comparison.
